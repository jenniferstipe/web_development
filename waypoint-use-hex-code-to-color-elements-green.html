Did you know there are other ways to represent colors in CSS? One of these ways is called hexadecimal code, 
or hex code for short.

Decimal means the numbers zero through nine - the numbers that people use in everyday life. Hexadecimal includes
these 10 numbers, plus the letters A, B, C, D, E and F. This means that Hexidecimal has a total of 16 possible 
values, instead of the 10 possible values that our normal base-10 number system gives us.

With CSS, we use 6 hexidecimal number to represent colors. For example, #000000 is the lowest possible value, and 
it represents the color black.

Many people feel overwhelmed by the possibilities of more than 16 million colors. And it's difficult to remember hex code. Fortunately, you can shorten it.

For example, red, which is #FF0000 in hex code, can be shortened to #F00. That is, one digit for red, one digit for green, one digit for blue.

This reduces the total number of possible colors to around 4,000. But browsers will interpret #FF0000 and #F00 as exactly the same color.

Another way you can represent colors in CSS is by using rgb values.

RGB values look like this: rgb(0, 0, 0) for black and rgb(255, 255, 255) for white.

Instead of using six hexadecimal digits like you do with hex code, with rbg you specify the brightness of each color with a number between 0 and 255.

If you do the math, 16 times 16 is 256 total values. So rgb, which starts counting from zero, has the exact same number of possible values as hex code.
